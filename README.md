# Sift

Note-taking is hard. I’ve always felt there’s a missing step between having an
idea and actually capturing it—and no app I tried quite filled that gap. So I
built one myself. I call it Sift.

Sift isn’t here to replace your existing note-taking system. It’s designed to
sit between you and your workflow. When inspiration strikes, you don’t want to
think—you just want to jot it down and move on. Sift is made exactly for that:
to catch your ideas the moment they appear, so you can return to them later..

## Installation

You need to have elm and elm-land which both you can probably install with

``` shell
npm install -g elm elm-land
```

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/omer-biz/sift.git
cd sift
npm install
elm-land server
```

after which you can go to `localhost:1234`
