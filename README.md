# Sift

Note-taking is hard. I’ve always felt there’s a missing step between having an
idea and actually capturing it—and no app I tried quite filled that gap. So I
built one myself. I call it Sift.

Sift isn’t here to replace your existing note-taking system. It’s designed to
sit between you and your workflow. When inspiration strikes, you don’t want to
think—you just want to jot it down and move on. Sift is made exactly for that:
to catch your ideas the moment they appear, so you can return to them later..
